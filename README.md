## Project Description 
**Problem:** Every year students buy new furniture every year to offset costs of storage and leading to tons of waste at the end of every semester.\
**Solution:** CollegeClutter is a website designed to connect students to other students and local storage facilities to collectively create optimal storage/selling opportunities.\
**Key Features:** The website will be a lightweight platform that will use collective data from user inputs to generate optimal storage options with other users and local storage facilities. The user will have a SPA interface to use commonplace data on furniture sets for ease of use and fast adoption. Users can list housing items for sale or buy items using the simple interface. \
**Why This Project?:** Waste and cost of living are both increasing at remarkable rate for students at Amherst. By offering a reasonable storage option we can give students an option to reduce costs between semesters and save on massive waste while improving local business outcomes during the down season.
